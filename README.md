# Mikrotik Porkbun DNS Updater Script (RouterOS v7)

This script is for [Mikrotik](https://mikrotik.com/) RouterOS v7 routers. It updates a Porkbun DNS record whenever there’s a change in the router’s public IP address.

It’s important to note that Mikrotik RouterOS already includes an [IP Cloud DDNS](https://wiki.mikrotik.com/wiki/Manual:IP/Cloud#DDNS) feature.
This feature works great and can be used to recursively update other records (using CNAME) that point to the dynamic DNS record generated by Mikrotik.

# Script Setup

## Have to be changed

* `PorkbunAPIKey` - A Porkbun API Key
* `PorkbunAPISecret` - A Porkbun API Secret
* `PorkbunDomain` - The domain you want to update (e.g., domain.com)
* `PorkbunSubdomain` - The subdomain you want to update (e.g., mywanip)

## Optional

* `RecordTTL` - The TTL of the record (default is 60)
* `UpdateDNS` - Update the DNS record if true, otherwise only log WAN IP changes (default is true)
* `CheckCertificate` - Check the SSL certificate of the domain (default is false)

## Notes

1. RouterOS script policies: read, write, test, and policy.
2. Remember to add a Scheduler that starts this script every 5 minutes, or any interval that suits your needs.

# Prerequisites

1. An API Key and Secret from Porkbun (obtainable [here](https://porkbun.com/account/api))
2. API Access enabled for the domain you want to update
